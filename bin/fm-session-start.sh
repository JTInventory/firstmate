# fm-session-start.sh - one command for the whole session start.
#
# Collapses AGENTS.md sections 3 (bootstrap) and 5 (recovery) into ONE script
# producing ONE ordered digest, so a session starts in one or two turns
# instead of the six-plus separate reads the old docs required: run
# fm-bootstrap.sh, then separately read data/projects.md, data/secondmates.md,
# data/captain.md, data/captain-shared.md, data/learnings.md, then run
# fm-lock.sh, fm-wake-drain.sh, then read data/backlog.md, every state/*.meta,
# and every state/*.status.
# Every one of those reads is UNCONDITIONAL at every session start, so they
# belong in a script, not in N agent turns.
#
# COMPOSITION, NOT DUPLICATION: this script calls fm-lock.sh, fm-bootstrap.sh,
# and fm-wake-drain.sh as real subprocesses and prints their real output. It
# never re-implements their logic; all sequencing/formatting logic added here
# stays local to this file. Those three scripts remain fully working
# standalone with unchanged default behavior - other flows (fm-bootstrap.sh
# install <tools> after consent, /updatefirstmate, the afk daemon, existing
# tests) still call them directly. The one seam this script needed -
# bootstrap running its detect-only diagnostics without its five mutating
# sweeps - is an opt-in FM_BOOTSTRAP_DETECT_ONLY=1 flag on fm-bootstrap.sh
# itself (default unset/0 = unchanged behavior), not a fork.
#
# ORDERING, and why LOCK now runs before BOOTSTRAP (the old AGENTS.md order
# was bootstrap-then-lock):
#
#   1. lock          - acquire the per-home session lock FIRST, before any
#                       mutating step runs.
#   2. bootstrap      - home-local stale Herdr projection cleanup runs only
#                       when this session actually holds the lock. Detect-only
#                       diagnostics always run. Bootstrap's five MUTATING sweeps
#                       (legacy PR-check migration, secondmate fast-forward,
#                       secondmate liveness, X-mode artifact writes, fleet sync)
#                       also run only when locked.
#   3. wake-drain     - mutates the durable wake queue, so it also only runs
#                       when locked.
#   4. read-once contract - the no-re-read rule covering every source in the
#                       two digests below.
#   5. fleet digest   - a compact data/backlog.md identity/metadata listing,
#                       every state/*.meta, a bounded state/*.status tail,
#                       state/.afk, and a cheap per-task endpoint-liveness read:
#                       read-only, always runs.
#   6. context digest - data/projects.md, data/secondmates.md, data/captain.md,
#                       data/captain-shared.md, data/learnings.md: read-only,
#                       always safe, always runs.
#   7. closing reminder - prints the context-specific watcher next step; this
#                       script points back to the emitted harness supervision
#                       block and deliberately never arms the watcher itself.
#
# On a Pi primary, the supervision-block step also checks whether Pi's two
# tracked primary extensions are loaded and prints a PI_WATCH_EXTENSION
# reminder line when one is missing.
#
# Why lock first: the old documented order (bootstrap, THEN lock) let a
# SECOND concurrent session run bootstrap's mutating sweeps - fast-forwarding
# secondmate homes, writing X-mode artifacts, fetching/fast-forwarding every
# project clone - before ever discovering another session already holds the
# lock. Two sessions racing those sweeps is exactly the hazard the lock
# exists to prevent, so locking first closes the hole outright: only the
# session that actually wins the lock ever touches shared mutable state.
#
# The tradeoff this ordering accepts: a refused (read-only) session must not
# go dark. So on refusal, bootstrap still runs (in FM_BOOTSTRAP_DETECT_ONLY=1
# mode) for its read-only detect lines - missing tools, gh auth, the
# worktree-tangle check, the harness override, crew-dispatch validation,
# tasks-axi and quota-axi tool checks, and tasks-axi availability - none of
# which mutate shared state and all of which are safe to compute without
# verified lock ownership.
# Only projection cleanup, the five bootstrap mutating sweeps, and the
# wake-queue drain are skipped.
# The context and fleet-state digests
# below are always read-only, so they run unconditionally in both modes.
#
# BACKLOG DIGEST: startup recovery drops done rows, keeps every in-flight,
# held, and blocked row, and bounds only ready queued rows. The ready bound is
# FM_SESSION_START_QUEUED_LIMIT, default 20, with an exact remainder disclosure.
# When compatible tasks-axi is selected and available, the shared tasks-axi
# backend probe remains the compatibility owner and this script asks
# `tasks-axi list` for separate in-flight, held, and blocked groups, plus
# `tasks-axi ready` for the dispatchable queued group. It never asks for bodies
# or done rows.
# When manual mode is selected, or tasks-axi is unavailable or incompatible,
# this script prints only backlog section headings and title lines. In-flight
# rows are always retained, title-line hold and blocked-by metadata keep held
# and blocked queued rows visible, and only plain queued rows are bounded.
# Full bodies are targeted follow-up only: `tasks-axi show <id> --full` when
# compatible tasks-axi is available, or `data/backlog.md` when the file body is
# truly needed.
#
# STATUS TAILS: FM_SESSION_START_STATUS_TAIL bounds how many lines each task's
# tail prints. bin/fm-line-cap-lib.sh bounds each line to 220 characters and
# appends ` [truncated]` when needed; the full status path remains visible.
#
# Usage: fm-session-start.sh
#   Prints the full ordered digest to stdout and always exits 0: this is a
#   reporting command, not a gate. A lock refusal is reported as a loud
#   banner inline, never a silent failure or a non-zero exit that would make
#   an agent skip the rest of the digest.

Everything below is printed in full for this session start: every state/*.meta,
a compact data/backlog.md listing, a bounded tail of every state/*.status,
data/projects.md, data/secondmates.md, data/captain.md, data/captain-shared.md,
and data/learnings.md.
Do NOT re-read any of them after reading this digest, and do NOT bulk-read
data/backlog.md or state/*.status: re-reading everything defeats the entire
point of this command.

Go to a source directly only when:
  - this digest flagged it ABSENT (then rebuild or create it per AGENTS.md),
  - its contents looked unparseable or corrupt,
  - an individual full status log is needed for older wake-event history, or a
    status line was capped and its tail matters (each task's full log path is
    printed with its tail),
  - a full task body is needed (tasks-axi show <id> --full, or data/backlog.md),
  - the backlog listing disclosed omitted queued items and this turn needs them,
  - or this digest was truncated before a section appeared, in which case
    reconcile that section's sources before acting on the incomplete digest.

This session did not acquire the fleet lock. Stay read-only: do not arm,
drain, spawn, steer, merge, or repair fleet state from here. Only a session
with verified fleet-lock ownership may perform mutable follow-up.

Away mode is active. Follow the supervision operating instructions block above:
load /afk and ensure the daemon is running, because the daemon owns watcher
supervision.

elif [ -f "$CONFIG/x-mode.env" ]; then
  cat <<EOF
Follow the supervision operating instructions block above for harness '$PRIMARY_HARNESS'.
X mode is active, so the emitted block's cadence instruction applies.
This script never starts supervision itself.

EOF
else
cat <<EOF
Follow the supervision operating instructions block above for harness '$PRIMARY_HARNESS'.
This script never starts supervision itself.

The digest above is complete for this session start. The READ-ONCE CONTRACT
section above governs what may still be read from disk. If a harness showed
only a preview and persisted the full digest, read that exact persisted file
before acting on the preview.
