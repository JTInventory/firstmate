# The bin/ toolbelt

The first mate drives these; interactive entrypoints work by hand too, while `*-lib.sh` files are sourced helpers.
Each file also starts with a short header comment.

| Script                   | Description                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fm-bootstrap.sh`        | Detect required toolchain problems, optional capability facts, and primary-checkout `TANGLE:` problems; refresh clones best-effort; install tools only after consent |
| `fm-fleet-sync.sh`       | Fetch clones, clean-fast-forward their checked-out default branches, and safely prune branches whose remote is gone |
| `fm-update.sh`           | Self-update the running firstmate repo and registered secondmate homes with fast-forward-only pulls from origin     |
| `fm-backlog-handoff.sh`  | Move already-judged in-scope queued backlog items from the main home into a seeded secondmate home                 |
| `fm-brief.sh`            | Scaffold a ship brief with a worktree-isolation assertion, a report-only scout brief with `--scout`, or a secondmate charter with `--secondmate` |
| `fm-ensure-agents-md.sh` | Ensure project `AGENTS.md` is the real memory file and `CLAUDE.md` symlinks to it                                   |
| `fm-guard.sh`            | Warn when the primary checkout is tangled, when queued wakes are pending, or when a stale or missing watcher needs a prominent banner |
| `fm-home-seed.sh`        | Lease/provision a secondmate home transactionally, clone projects, initialize gates, and maintain `data/secondmates.md` |
| `fm-spawn.sh`            | Spawn one task, several `id=repo` pairs, or a persistent secondmate with `--secondmate`; ship/scout spawns require an isolated treehouse worktree |
| `fm-project-mode.sh`     | Resolve a project's delivery mode and `+yolo` flag from `data/projects.md`                                          |
| `fm-merge-local.sh`      | Fast-forward a `local-only` project's local default branch after approval                                           |
| `fm-review-diff.sh`      | Review a crewmate branch against the authoritative base, with optional `--stat` output                              |
| `fm-watch-arm.sh`        | Verified per-home watcher re-arm; reports `started`, `healthy`, or `FAILED`; `--restart` relaunches only this home's watcher |
| `fm-watch.sh`            | Singleton-safe one-shot watcher; blocks until supervision work is due, queues it durably, then exits with one reason line |
| `fm-supervise.sh`        | Read-only operational checklist and `firstmate.supervision.v1` `--json` model from state, tmux, treehouse, git, and GitHub signals |
| `fm-supervise-daemon.sh` | Presence-gated sub-supervisor for walk-away (`/afk`) supervision: wraps `fm-watch.sh`, self-handles routine wakes in bash, and escalates only captain-relevant events as one verified, batched, single-line digest prefixed with a sentinel marker |
| `fm-tangle-lib.sh`       | Shared default-branch resolution and primary-checkout tangle classification sourced by bootstrap and guard         |
| `fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh`    | Shared `tasks-axi` compatibility probe sourced by bootstrap and teardown                                            |
| `fm-wake-drain.sh`       | Atomically drain queued watcher wakes before handling supervision work                                              |
| `fm-wake-lib.sh`         | Shared durable wake queue and portable lock helpers sourced by the watcher, drain, arm, guard, and daemon          |
| `fm-send.sh`             | Send one verified literal line (or `--key Escape`) to a crewmate window; exits non-zero when Enter is positively swallowed |
| `fm-tmux-lib.sh`         | Shared tmux pane primitives for busy detection, dim-ghost-aware and border-aware composer detection, and verified submit retry |
| `fm-peek.sh`             | Print a bounded tail of a crewmate pane                                                                             |
| `fm-pr-check.sh`         | Record a PR-ready task and arm the watcher's merge poll                                                             |
| `fm-promote.sh`          | Promote a scout task in place so it becomes a protected ship task                                                   |
| `fm-teardown.sh`         | Return the worktree or retire/release a secondmate home; protects ship work, requires scout reports, checks child work, and prints the backlog reminder |
| `fm-harness.sh`          | Detect the running harness; resolve the effective crewmate harness                                                  |
| `fm-lock.sh`             | Per-home firstmate session lock                                                                                     |

## Read-only supervision model

`bin/fm-supervise.sh` is passive: it reads local state, tmux liveness, treehouse status, git worktree state, and GitHub PR/status data, then prints either a short checklist or JSON.
It does not change state files, backlog files, tmux panes, git branches, treehouse leases, services, teardown state, merge state, or GitHub.

```sh
bin/fm-supervise.sh                 # text checklist
bin/fm-supervise.sh --include-ok    # include routine watch items in text
bin/fm-supervise.sh --json          # firstmate.supervision.v1 model
bin/fm-supervise.sh --schema        # v1 schema without reading runtime state
bin/fm-supervise.sh --external-pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
bin/fm-supervise.sh --no-default-reminders
```

The JSON model always includes `schema_version: "firstmate.supervision.v1"`, `read_only: true`, and top-level `sources`, `summary`, `checklist`, `tasks`, `worktrees`, and `external_reminders`.
GitHub read failures are data, not command failures: affected PRs become `unknown`, `sources.github.ok` becomes `false`, and the command still exits successfully.
By default, the command includes Firstmate PR `https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/pull/68` as an external reminder; use `--no-default-reminders` to omit it or `--external-pr` to add more reminder PRs.
